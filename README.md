# Overview

Hello. This is a test program where I tried to learn more about Rust as a language, as well as better programming practices.

This program leverages Rust's standard file I/O functions to open a file and get bytes out of it.

As mentioned above, I wrote this to learn more about Rust as a language, which in turn has taught me more about good programming practices.

Here's a short video detailed the program as well as what I learned:

# Development Environment

I used the Rust std library entirely on this project.

I used VS Studio and one of the many Rust extentions.

- [Rust Official Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)

# Future Work

- Add ability to write to file
- Write over statements found in file with regexp
- Add some better error handling
